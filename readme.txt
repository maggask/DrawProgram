# Google Chrome is the default browser for this application.
# All shapes are implemented, text having some minor faults. We were not able to set focus to the input field and the second time the text is used the input field dissapears when the mouse is moved, but you can still write in it when clicked. In some cases the text option prints out undefined on the canvas, we haven't figured out the source of it (some null reference). The textbutton is pressed and after the canvas is clicked the input field appears. The text in the input field appears on the canvas on enter.
# All shapes except text can change colour and size of linewidth. You can play a little bit with the linewith using the plus and minus button, the default size will either get larger or smaller each time the buttons are pressed. Try it!
# Undo and redo is implemented. It's possible to undo every object on the canvas and redo it. If undo is pressed and than a new object is drawn redo will not make the last object undone reappear.
# The application is done with Object Oriented Programming and is implemented with inheritence. All functionality is in the classes in shapeClasses.js.
# Objects are NOT movable.
# The drawing on the canvas can be saved locally on you computer, by pressing the floppy disk icon.
# The upload button does NOT have any functionality.
